# Hearthstone API

When creating an API, I figured its best to do something that you know well. Although, I do know a lot about games (board games, sports, video games), this one leaped out at me as the one I should do because its a mixture of my two favorite types of games( video games and card games).

### Prerequisites
In order to fully enjoy my API, that is currently only local. First you need a IDE (I used InteliJ, so I'll be using that to explain how to access it). I also used Postman for this example as well. First thing is run the App from your IDE. Next, go to localhost:4567/cardtexts/new. Where do I enter that you say, in Postman but make sure to change the radio button to raw and the type to JSON application/JSON in the dropdown. Copy the format that I provided to create your own card!

### Built with
* [InteliJ](http://www.InteliJ.com) - The IDE used.
* [Spark](https://spark.com/) - Routing Management.
* [Postman](https://postman.com) - Used to generate API Feeds
